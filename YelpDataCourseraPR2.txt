Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 row 
ii. Business table = 10000 row 
iii. Category table = 10000 row 
iv. Checkin table = 10000 row 
v. elite_years table = 10000 row
vi. friend table = 10000 row
vii. hours table = 10000 row
viii. photo table = 10000 row
ix. review table = 10000 row
x. tip table = 10000 row
xi. user table = 10000 row
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.
Note:
	When I make total distinct records by foreign key then I will note (.....), vice versa only have total number
i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562 (get from business_id)
iii. Category = 2643 (get from business_id)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (get from business_id)
v. Review = 10000 
vi. Checkin = 493 (get from business_id)
vii. Photo = 10000 
viii. Tip = 537 (get from user_id)
ix. User = 10000 
x. Friend = 11 (get from user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (get from user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
city: Toronto       category: Restaurants




i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
No, 

My code: 
select b.city, c.category ,  b.stars, count(b.stars) as quality_point, h.hours
from business b 
inner join category c on b.id == c.business_id
inner join hours h on b.id == h.business_id

where  c.category = 'Restaurants' 
and b.city = 'Toronto'
group by b.stars



ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
     Yes, 
	
     	stars 2, 3 have sum review is 602 
	stars 4, 5 have sum review is 683  
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
Based on the analysis results, I found that the two groups have the stars of the two groups most of the time with the same neighborhood score. 
Groups of 4 and 5 will mostly open 7 days a week and have a longer opening time frame and most of them will be open from afternoon to night.
 Groups 2 and 3 open shorter time frames and sometimes only open 3, 4 days a week

SQL code used for analysis:

select b.city, c.category , b.neighborhood, b.stars, h.hours
from business b 
inner join category c on b.id == c.business_id
inner join hours h on b.id == h.business_id

where  c.category = 'Restaurants'  
and b.city = 'Toronto'
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
Most Group business is opening then rating high and closing then have rating lower
         
ii. Difference 2:
Most Group business is opening have quantity of the review very high and closing then very lower


         
SQL code used for analysis:
select b.city, c.category , b.neighborhood, b.stars, h.hours, b.is_open, b.review_count
from business b 
inner join category c on b.id == c.business_id
inner join hours h on b.id == h.business_id

where  c.category = 'Restaurants'  
and b.city = 'Toronto' 
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
I will analysis, Why companies have rating from 4 to 5 and the other company have rating very lower

ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
 + Affect reviews of user have fans
 + I will quantity of review of company 
 + Text review have "delicious", "loved", "not bad" affect Evaluate of user
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

1.  Affect reviews of user have fans

+---------+------+-------+-------------------------------------+--------+
| name    | fans | stars | name                                | stars  |
+---------+------+-------+-------------------------------------+--------+
| W       |    4 |     5 | Fire Station Dog Park               |    3.5 |
| Marlene |    3 |     4 | TENDER Steak & Seafood              |    3.5 |
| Just    |    3 |     4 | Budget Rent A Car                   |    2.0 |
| Ed      |    0 |     3 | Hong Kong Garden Seafood & BBQ Cafe |    3.0 |
+---------+------+-------+-------------------------------------+--------+
I see dataset had loss data, With this infor if user have fans very high then affect alot of stars 

2. I will quantity of review of company 
+-------+--------------+
